# Cluster Watcher

Experimental project to see how PowerShell as a backend would work.

The idea was to have a series of user defined device configurations, then backend could ping for status using PS Remoting.

**Development**

- TypeScript, SASS, Vue
- vue-cli-service bundling / building / dev web server
- PowerShell backend + web server
